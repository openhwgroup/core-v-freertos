# CORE-V-MCU FREERTOS

This project provides FreeRTOS and drivers for development of real-time
applications on the core-v-mcu.

Programs can be run using RTL simulation (simulating the hardware design) or the
virtual platform (called gvsoc, software emulation of the hardware design).

A book about FreeRTOs can be found
[here](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/RTOS_book.html) and the official
documentation is available on [this website](https://www.freertos.org/features.html).

## Getting Started
You need the following items to develop and run FreeRTOS programs for PULP
* A centos7 or ubuntu18 based workstation
* This repository
* A C compiler that supports the RISC-V instruction set, either pulp-riscv-gcc
  or riscv-gcc.
* (optional) A compiled core-v-mcu hardware design if you intend to use rtl simulation

At the end of this section you should be able to run your own hello world
program, either using the virtual platform or a rtl simulation of a PULP based
platform.

### Repository
Run
```bash
git clone TODO-UPDATE-PATH.git --recurse-submodules
```
in your shell. The `--recurse-submodules` argument is mandatory.

### Compiler
If you want to use the PULP extension (additional instructions such as hardware
loops, DSP etc.) then get the source code from
[here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain) and compile it
according to the manual there or (easier) download the latest binary release
from [here](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases).
Make sure you choose the correct distribution, otherwise you might run into ABI
issues.

If you want to use upstream RISC-V gcc then you can get it from
[here](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain), but you need to configure
and compile it yourself.

Now make sure that either
* the installation path of the newly acquired compiler is in your `PATH` environment variable or
* you set the `RISCV` environment variable to point to it

In both cases you need to point to the "root" folder of the compiler
installation, meaning you point to the directory that contains `bin`, `include`,
`lib` etc.

### (Optional) core-v-mcu RTL design
Get the latest release of
 [CORE-V-MCU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu) and compile it by
 running `make build`. Afterwards make sure you source the configuration files
 to make this repository aware of your compiled RTL platform by calling `source
 setup/vsim.sh`

### Setting up and running a hello world
Now that we have a compiler and a platform to run our programs on, we can set up
a simple hello world, a program that prints `"hello world"` to `stdout`. Note
that `stdout` is both in the rtl simulation and the virtual platform represented
by a pseudo device (i.e. not existing in real-hardware). This is useful for
debugging purposes, but for a more realistic scenario you can look a the
`test/uart` program.

1. Copy `template/helloworld` into a directory of your chosing
2. Run `source env/your-platform.sh` to target the desired platform and make
   `helloworld` aware where to find the FreeRTOS source files and drivers
3. Run `make all` to compile the example program
4. Call `make run-sim` to do an RTL simulation or `make run-gvsoc` to do a
   virtual platform simulation of the example program

You should see "hello world" being printed to your terminal.

### Setting up and running blinky
Blinky is the canonical FreeRTOS example program. On hardware (FPGA) it will
blink a led, in the RTL simulation it will toggle an gpio pad and print "blink"
to stdout and on the virtual platform we just get the latter. Internally the
program will instantiate two tasks, a receive and a send tasks, that communicate
with each other over a queue (a FreeRTOS IPC primitive).

1. Copy `template/blinky` into a directory of your chosing
2. Run `source env/your-platform.sh` to target the desired platform and make
   `blinky` aware where to find the FreeRTOS source files and drivers
3. Run `make all` to compile the example program
4. Call `make run-sim` to do an RTL simulation or `make run-gvsoc` to do a
   virtual platform simulation of the example program

You should see a stream of "Blink" being printed to stdout.

### Tree of your (typical) project
Once you have compiled a program your project's tree will roughly look like this
(here demonstranted on helloworld).

```
.
├── FreeRTOSConfig.h     FreeRTOS specific macros that enable/disable features
├── gvsim                Simulation output of a virtual platform simulation
├── helloworld           Your compiled program
├── helloworld.c         Source files
├── helloworld.hex       Hexdump of your program (not used)
├── helloworld.lst       Disassembly, symbol table and header of your program
├── helloworld.map       Linker map of your program (linked and discarded sections)
├── helloworld.o         Object files
├── helloworld.stim      Stimuli files (format that can be used by rtl simulation)
├── helloworld.veri      Verilog memory dump for faster rtl simulations
├── Makefile             Compile, run, analyze. Check make target
└── sim                  Simulation output of a RTL simulation
```


### TL;DR
1. Install compiler, point `RISCV` and/or the `PATH` to it
2. Use one of the given templates and copy it
3. (Optional) Install the RTL platform with `make build` and refer to it with `source
   setup/vsim.sh`
4. `source env/your-platform.sh` in this project's root to make the template
   aware of this project source files
5. `make all run-sim` or `make all run-gvsoc` to compile and simulate

## Environment Variables  and Configuration Options
See `env/default-config.sh`
* `CONFIG_FREERTOS_KERNEL=y/n` (default y) Use the FreeRTOS kernel
* `CONFIG_USE_NEWLIB=y/n` (default y) Use newlib libc

* `CONFIG_DRIVER_PLIC=y/n` (default n) Use the PLIC driver
* `CONFIG_DRIVER_FLL=y/n` (default y) Use the FLL driver
* `CONFIG_DRIVER_CLKDIV=y/n` (default n) Use the clock divider driver

* `CONFIG_CC_LTO=y/n` (default n) Use link-time optimizations
* `CONFIG_CC_SANITIZE=y/n` (default n) Use address sanitizers
* `CONFIG_CC_STACKDBG=y/n` (default n) Generate stack debugging information
* `CONFIG_CC_MAXSTACKSIZE=int` (default 1024) Limit maximum stack size


## Custom Build Directory and Out-Of-Tree Builds
Out-of-Tree builds and by extension custom build directories are supported using
GNU Make's `VPATH` feature, though a bit unwieldy. You need to cd into the
desired build directory and invoke `make` from there pointing to the program's
Makefile with by providing an appropriate argument to the `-f` switch and
setting `VPATH` to point to the program's source directory.

Example of using a custom build directory:
```bash
cd nortos/hello_world
mkdir build
cd build
make -f ../makefile all VPATH=..
```

## Developer Notes
`assert()` from `#include <assert.h>` calls `__assert_func`, `fiprintf` then
`abort`. This is all in newlib.


## Licenses
Description of all the licenses used in the repository. In general we use Apache
2.0 except for some cases where it makes sense to use the underlying code's
original license. For example the kernel and the demo application stays MIT
licensed.

We give a directory/filelist as a overview where on the left side a
directory/file is given and on the right side the license it is distributed
under. If we refer to a directory then the given license applies to all files
within, except for subtrees that have a seperate license (also given in this
list).

```bash
[dir-name]          # [spdx-license qualifier]

demos/              # MIT
kernel/             # MIT
template/           # MIT
env/                # Apache-2.0
scripts/            # Apache-2.0
tests/              # Apache-2.0 except for FreeRTOSConfig.h which is MIT
nortos/             # Apache-2.0 except for FreeRTOSConfig.h which is MIT
drivers/            # Apache-2.0
target/             # Apache-2.0
